# Installation

::code-group

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm add @trpc/server @trpc/client trpc-nuxt zod
```

```bash [npm]
npm install @trpc/server @trpc/client trpc-nuxt zod
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add @trpc/server @trpc/client trpc-nuxt zod
```

::

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  build: {
    transpile: [/trpc-nuxt/]
  }
})
```

#### Why @trpc/server?

For implementing tRPC endpoints and routers.

#### Why @trpc/client?

For making typesafe API calls from your client.

#### Why zod?

Most examples use [Zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod) for input validation and tRPC.io highly recommends it, though it isn't required.

## Next Steps
